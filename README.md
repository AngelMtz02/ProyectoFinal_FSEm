## GC : Greenhouse control  

**GC** is an academic project developed to transform a Raspberry Pi 4 into a greenhouse control. The system allows users to which allows you to remotely monitor and manage a greenhouse.

## Features  

 - Irrigation system on and off  
 - Graph display with temperature, irrigation history, and actions taken  
 - Greenhouse temperature control using PID  
 - Radiator power control (incandescent light bulb)  
 - Fan power control (CPU fan or any other DC motor)  
 - Temperature and irrigation cycle scheduling  
 - The embedded system will incorporate a web server for remote control (local via IP) of the functions described above.
